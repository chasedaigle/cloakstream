## Soon
* clean up CSS in the views
* clean up player controls
* add option for turning on or off autoplay

## Later
* control panel for changing config?
* maybe a user system?

## Future
* once CouchPotato supports movie library, integrate that
* [unfortunate link](http://h264.code-shop.com/trac/discussion/topic/98) : once mod_h264_streaming supports mkv containers (because they can be in h264 as well), integrate that
